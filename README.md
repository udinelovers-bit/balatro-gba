# **Build Instructions:**

## **-Docker-**
A docker compose file is provided to build this project. 

1.) Install [docker desktop](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). 

2.) Open a terminal to this projects directory:
- On **linux** run `UID=$(id -u) GID=$(id -g) docker compose up`
- On **windows** run `docker compose up`

Docker will build the project and the ROM will be in the same location as step 7 describes below.

## **-Windows-**

### With `Git` (not required)
1.) Install `devkitPro` from https://github.com/devkitPro/installer by downloading the latest release, unzipping the archive, and then running the installer. You only need to install the tools for the GBA development so ensure you have it selected and install it to the default directory. You may need to create a temp folder for the project.

2.) Search for `MSys2` in the Start Menu and open it.

3.) Install `Git` by typing this command: `pacman -S git` if you don't have it already installed

4.) Clone the project by putting `git clone https://github.com/cellos51/balatro-gba.git` in the MSys2 window.

5.) Use `cd` and drag the new folder into the window to add the file path and press Enter.

6.) Type `make` into the window and press Enter to start building the rom.

7.) After it completes, navigate through the `build` directory in the project folder and look for `balatro-gba.gba` and load it on an emulator or flashcart.
### Without `Git`
Disregard Steps 3-4 and instead click the green code button on the main repository page and press `Download Zip`. Unzip the folder and place it wherever you like. Then continue from Step 5.
## **Common Issues:**

#### 1. **When I run `make` it errors out and won't compile!**
- Move the project folder to your desktop and then `cd` to it by dragging the folder into the terminal window. This error could be caused by a bad file path, placing the folder on the desktop is a failsafe.

#### 2. **I can't find the compiled rom!**
- Look for a folder called `build` inside the project folder and then find `balatro-gba.gba`.

#### 3. **The Game won't start!**
- Try a different emulator or if you are using original hardware, make sure the rom is not corrupted and try a different flashcart or SD Card. If this does not work, open an issue on the Github page because a recent commit may have broke the game.

#### 4. **It says I don't have `Git` or `Make` installed!**
- Use `pacman -S git` (not required) or `pacman -S make` although make should already be installed if you followed the instructions correctly.
